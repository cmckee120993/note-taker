# Note Taker
 

  

  
 ## Description
  
 This project allows users to take notes, save them to a database, view all notes in the database, and then delete them when they are finished with their notes. The program uses Express to create the get, post, and delete requests to the database. The database is a json file that stores the information. JavaScript is used to create the fetch requests and connect the front of the the website to Express and, thus, the back end.
